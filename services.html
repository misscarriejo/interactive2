          <h4>Basic Eye Examination</h4>

          <p>Includes a fully comprehensive examination of the eye to check vision and to screen for cataracts, macular degeneration, glaucoma, and other medical conditions. Also included is a written prescription for glasses, if needed.</p>

          <p>A Fundus examination, which is used to evaluate the health of the eye, is also part of the full examination. This diagnostic procedure can be conducted by using either dilation drops or Optomap (digital retinal scan).</p>

          <p>If the patient decides to go with the dilation drops we recommend the patient brings someone to drive them afterwards because they will be experiencing side effects of blurry vision and ultra sensitivity to light. The side effects usually last on average 2 - 3 hours. Dilation drops are included in the initial price.

          <p>Alternatively the Optomap is a noninvasive retinal scan of the back of the eye. This method has no post side effects that are associated with dilation drops. Optomap is an additional $35 charge.</p>
